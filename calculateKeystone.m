function[k, kbu, ktd, kdir, kindir] = calculateKeystone(A)
%It calculates the keystone indices described in 
%Jord치n, F., Tak치cs-S치nta, A., & Moln치r, I. (1999). A reliability theoretical quest for keystones. Oikos, 453-462.

%The results of this code have been tested against the software Graph by
%CosbiLab. This function was originally coded by Wei-Chung Liu in R and then
%implemented in MATLAB by Emanuele Giacomuzzo.

%Watch out: the food web you are using needs to be a directed acyclic graph: 
%it needs to be without self-loops and without simple cycles. You can
%transform the adjacency matrix of the graph into the adjacency matrix of a
%DAG by using the function createDAG of the Food Web Analysis Toolbox. 

%---INPUT---
%A = adjacency matrix of the directed graph. The rows should be the preys
%and the columns should be the predators.

%---OUTPUT---
%k = keystone index
%kbu = keystone index for bottom-up effects
%ktd = keystone index for top-down effects
%kdir = keystone index for directed effects
%kindir = keystone index for indirected effects
