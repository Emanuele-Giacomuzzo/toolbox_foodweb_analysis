function [s,cs,ns] = statusIndices(A)

%The results of this code have been tested against the software Graph by
%CosbiLab.

%Watch out: the food web you are using needs to be a directed acyclic graph: 
%it needs to be without self-loops and without simple cycles. You can
%transform the adjacency matrix of the graph into the adjacency matrix of a
%DAG by using the function createDAG of the Food Web Analysis Toolbox. 
%
%A = adjacency matrix of the directed graph. The rows should be the preys
%and the columns should be the predators.


%Network: binary, directed, loop-less. This code was tested against
%CosbiLab results. 

%Watch out: the food web you are using needs to be loopless: it doesn't
%need to contain neither self-loops or simple cycles.
